# About Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an app that gives you a list of things to link to, and it's really
great. If you want to use it, you can do that.

This page should probably be edited. If you want to put a heading, you can use
the `##` characters - each one represents `H1`, `H2`, `H3` etc. so
`H1` == `# Hello` and `H2` == `## Hello`. Plus, [links are](/about) quite easy.
